<div style="width:50%; margin-left:25%">
    <h1>Okay! Hello ... let's go</h1>

    <p>Open a terminal of your choice (Terminator, XTERM, whatever you like...)</p>

    <pre>
    touch $HOME/.netrc
</pre>

<pre>
    gedit $HOME/.netrc
</pre>

<p>Add the following three lines to the file (.netrc). Florian will tell you what to use instead of 'XXX'</p>

<pre>
    machine projects.cit-ec.uni-bielefeld.de
    login XXX
    password XXX
</pre>

<p>Save the file (CTRL+s), close gedit.</p>
<p>In the shell again, clone the CITK recipe repository as shown below.</p>

<pre>
    cd /media/local_data/citk/
    mkdir -p dist && cd dist
    git clone https://opensource.cit-ec.de/git/citk .
</pre>

<p>Okay, fine. Now you have all the recipes in order to install the Pepper System.</p>
<p>Next you need to start the Jenkins CI Server. We already deployed one for your convenience :D</p>

<pre>
    /media/local_data/citk/jenkins/start_jenkins
</pre>

<p>Well, now open a web browser of your choice and go to: <a target="_blank" href="https://localhost:8080/">CLICK
   HERE!</a>. BTW, the CI Server is running on the machine in front of you. You should see something like this:
</p>

<img width="100%" src="images/ci_server_started.png"/>

<p>Login to the Jenkins (top right corner) use the user: citec and password: citec</p>
<p>Yeah, back to the terminal open another terminal please, <b>don't</b> close the first one since the Jenkins CI
   Server in running inside that terminal...</p>
<p>Now you'll generate all the necessary build jobs that will eventually deploy (install) the entire system for you
   AUTOMAGICALLY.</p>

<pre>
    cd /media/local_data/citk/jenkins
    ./job-configurator --on-error=continue \
    -d /media/local_data/citk/dist/distributions/pepper-robocup-nightly.distribution \
    -m toolkit -D toolkit.volume=/media/local_data/citk/systems -u citec -p citec \
    -D make.threads=6 -D cudagen=Pascal  --cache-directory=/tmp/cache_dir
</pre>

<p>What happens now is that our magic works. After this command has finished (which could take a while) go
        back to the <a target="_blank" href="https://localhost:8080/">JENKINS</a>. You should see a lot of new jobs
        that are grey (they haven't been built yet). YES! Just build them. You don't need to trigger them all manually,
        just look for the build job <b>pepper-robocup-nightly-toolkit-orchestration</b> and click on the tiny
        <b>clock</b> icon to the right.
</p>

<p>Now the entire system is build and deployed on your system. When it's done you should see all job become <b><span style="color:blue;">BLUE</span></b>. You are now done. For further instructions, ask Florian.</p>

<p>What you can do is:</p>

<pre>
    cd /media/local_data/citk/systems/pepper-robocup-nightly/bin
    ./vdemo_pepper-default.sh
</pre>
